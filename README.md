# ðŸŒŸ Local Buzz

*Local Buzz* is a hyperlocal social app built to help communities discover whatâ€™s happening around them â€” fast, local, and meaningful.  
It shows Reads (local posts) and Polls within a *100 km radius*, ensuring users always get neighbourhood updates.

Polls auto-expire after 24 hours to keep conversations fresh. Users can like, comment, share, and bookmark posts. A Trending feed highlights posts that gain traction (likes + comments).  

The app also includes real-time notifications, username search, profile pages with live post counts, and customizable settings (theme, font size, reset posts). For privacy & security thereâ€™s an App Lock (PIN) and authentication via Email/Password + Google Sign-in.
